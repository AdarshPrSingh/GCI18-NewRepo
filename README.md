# GCI18-NewRepo


           My first task of GCI-2018

This is my first task of Google Code-in, so I'm very exited 
to work in open source community and explore the things and 
eager to learn from here.

            First Organization to work

I would like  to complete the tasks provided by Sustainable Computing Research Lab (SCoRe).
Its best part is to work and get guidance form mentors.
Hope I'll learn a lot of interesting things.
